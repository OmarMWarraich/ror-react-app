<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [RoR React Blog] <a name="about-project"></a>

## Project Description

The frontend is built using React and the backend is built using Ruby on Rails while PostgreSQL is used as the database. The application allows users to create an account and log in. Users can create, edit, and delete posts. Users can also upload images to their posts. The application also has a search functionality that allows users to search for posts by title. The application also has pagination that allows users to navigate through the posts. The backend is hosted on an EC2 instance using docker-compose while the frontend is hosted through AWS-Amplify while using Route 53 for DNS.
